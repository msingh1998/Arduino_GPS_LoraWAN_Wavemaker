This is to connect GPS sensor with arduino and parsing data to get GPS coordinates.
This also gets data from load sensors connected to arduino.
The data is then being transmitted to other arduino using communication protocol called "LoRa WAN". 
You must have a hardware LoRaWAN and arduino device in order to run this code. 
Enjoy
